    According to RFC 3986, both the scheme and host are case-insensitive.
    Therefore, this function normalizes both before constructing the pool
    key for an HTTPS request. If you wish to change this behaviour, provide
    alternate callables to ``key_fn_by_scheme``.

        request_context: An object that contain the context for a request.

    Returns:
        A namedtuple that can be used as a connection pool key.
